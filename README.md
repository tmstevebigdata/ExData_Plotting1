### 1) Purpose

```
The purpose of this project is to here is simply to examine how household energy usage
varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. The task is to reconstruct the following
plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular
repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual
household electric power consumption Data Set” which has been made available on the course
web site.

First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository:-
https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

For each plot you should:-

* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of
  480 pixels.

* Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.

* Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding
  plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include
  code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You must also include
  the code that creates the PNG file.

* Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository
  (no need for separate sub-folders).

When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub so that the
GitHub version of your repository is up to date. There should be four PNG files and four
R code files, a total of eight files in the top-level folder of the repo.
```

The four plots that you will need to construct are shown below.

### 2) Files contained in GitHub Repo

The GitHub repo consist of 9 files as detailed below:-

```
1) README.md - This file explains the purpose of the project and the steps on how to run the
   R scripts.

2) plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R - The R source files used to product the output plots
   in PNG format.

3) plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, plot4.png - The plot output files in PNG format.
```

### 3) Data Source

Data used for this course project is obtained from the link below:-

**https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip**

### 4) How to run the R scripts

```
Step 1 - Download the R scripts to a local directory

Step 2 - Download the data from the link given above in Item 3 - Data Source

Step 3 - Extract the data in the same directory that contains the R script files

Step 4 - Change the Working Directory in R script in the setwd(<Working Directory>) command
         to point to your local directory and save it

Step 5 - Run the R script
```
